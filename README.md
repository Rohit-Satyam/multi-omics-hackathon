## Literature to refer

1. [Evaluation and comparison of multi-omics data integration methods for cancer subtyping](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009224)



### Running the tutorial materials

To run the tutorial materials you will need:

1. The Jupyter notebook with the R language support:

  - Jupyter Notebook [(installation information)](https://jupyter.org/install)
  - R from CRAN-R [(download from here)](https://cloud.r-project.org)
  - IRKernel which enables the usage of R from the notebooks [(see tutorial here)](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-run-r-scripts-in-jupyter-15527148d2a)

2. R packages (see the instructions in the *set_up.R* file)

3. python3.6+ [(download from here)](https://www.python.org/downloads)

4. SUMO: the subtyping tool for multi-omic data [(installation information)](https://github.com/ratan-lab/sumo)

### Resources & Aknowledgements
